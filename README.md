## Simple NLP Chatbot using wit.ai for Speech Recognition + NLP processing, and Google Cloud Text-To-Speech service to make it speak.

Boilerplate for future development, requires both wit.ai (API key set in WIT_AI_ACCESS_TOKEN env) and Google Cloud account with enabled Text-To-Speech API (API key set in GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS env)

Heavily limited by APIs processing time, especially wit.io
Privately developing BOT using mycroft's Adapt Intent Parser + offline TTS tools + Qt for Python.

### Required packages for Ubuntu 18.04
`sudo apt install portaudio19-dev ffmpeg`
